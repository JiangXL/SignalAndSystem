# Introduction

Using mathematical techniques to help analyze and synthesize systems which 
process signals.

Signal Variable: Time, spatial
Continous(Most natural signal is countinous, but why?)
Discrete

Determinstic Signal, random signal

Periodic Signals

A signal can be divide into the sum of even function and odd function

Left- and right-sided signals
Bouned and unbounded signals--- stability
Exponential signals
